Task Tracker CLI

Overview
Task Tracker CLI is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing tasks. It allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks, as well as track their statuses (todo, in-progress, done). Tasks are stored in a JSON file in the current directory, making it easy to persist and manage your tasks.

Features
- Add tasks
- Update task descriptions
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as **todo**, **in-progress**, or **done**
- List tasks by status or show all tasks
